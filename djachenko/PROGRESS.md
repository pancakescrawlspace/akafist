# Progress log — Дьяченко digitisation

See PLAN.md for the phases. Newest entry last.

## 2026-09-19
- Investigated existing online editions: Azbyka and dhonorare.ru are page images; Wikisource index has no OCR layer
  and two transcribed pages. Conclusion: text must be produced from a scan (PLAN.md, "Findings").
- Wrote PLAN.md. No scan downloaded yet, no scripts written yet.

- Phase 0 decisions (user accepted the defaults of PLAN.md):
  1. Scope: build the full `entries.tsv`; render the akathist-lemma subset first, the full dictionary later.
  2. Headword encoding: civil pre-reform script (ѣ і ѳ ѵ ъ kept, no titla/superscripts) + normalised modern key.
  3. Proofreading: targeted — akathist lemmas first, then any PDF subset, then the rest as time allows; `status`
     column tracks it; unchecked entries marked in the PDF.
  4. OCR route: decided in Phase 2 by measurement.
  Phase 0 done.

- Phase 1 (same day, later): compared candidate scans; chose archive.org item 20200215_20200215_0856 (600 ppi) —
  see SOURCE.md. Found that it carries an ABBYY OCR layer with pre-reform orthography, character boxes/confidence and
  formatting (headwords and Greek garbled but detectable). PLAN.md revised (revision 2) accordingly: Phase 3 becomes
  "reuse ABBYY text; recover headwords + Greek", effort estimate halved.
- Wrote tools/dj_fetch.py; downloaded the metadata and OCR layers (verified); JP2 zip download started
  (`python3 tools/dj_fetch.py --jp2 --extract --convert --manifest`, log in djachenko/scan/fetch.log).

- JP2 zip downloaded and verified, 1,159 leaves extracted (pages/jp2/, 600 ppi) and converted to 300 ppi JPEGs
  (pages/NNNN.jpg, 3.9 GB). manifest.tsv built: all leaves status `image`; page map checked (printed page = leaf − 37
  for the dictionary proper, no gaps); sections front/main/back set. Phase 1 done except for the letter boundaries
  and the supplement start, which Phase 3a fills from the ABBYY layer.

- Phase 3a (second session, same day): wrote tools/dj_abbyy.py and ran it over all 1,159 leaves (6 s; deterministic,
  checked; headwords filled in later survive a re-run). Output: djachenko/ocr/NNNN.json (57 MB, schema in the script's
  docstring — it supersedes the sketch in PLAN.md) and ocr/report.tsv (per-page statistics and warnings).
  - Layout: column rule → gutter and deskew; header/footer/letter initials/specks set aside; lines grouped into
    geometric paragraphs (a new one at every flush line), in reading order across bands (a letter initial in mid-page
    splits the page into two bands). Checked by eye against the page images on leaves 102, 150, 155, 201, 303, 465,
    902, 1124 and 1157.
  - Result: 25,362 entry candidates in main + supplement, 22,542 of them with "=" in their first two lines ("=" signs
    in all: 24,483; the book's "~30,000 entries" is a round figure). Consistency indicators: ~44 likely false starts
    and ~10 likely missed starts in the unambiguous (geometric) part.
  - Found and handled: left margin cut off on 242 left-hand pages (123 main, 119 of 128 in the supplement) — first
    letters of headwords missing from the image; there entry starts come from position + text features (naive Bayes)
    and 3,197 paragraphs are marked `guessed`. 18 headwords exist only as ABBYY picture blocks (placeholder U+FFFC in
    the text). Paper patch over the lower left column of p. 1120. Details in SOURCE.md ("Scan defects").
  - manifest.tsv: section (front/main/blank/supplement/back) and letters per page, from the book's table of contents
    (leaf 37; pp. 865–1120 are a supplement "Прибавленіе" with its own А–Я sequence; p. 864 blank); the detected letter
    initials agree with the TOC except on 3 explained pages. Front matter corrected by hand: leaf 1 = p. I, leaves 2–6 =
    pp. IV–VIII, pp. II–III missing from the scan. The OCR'd running-head page numbers confirm the page map.
  - PLAN.md revision 3: Phase 2 ground truth should include a cut-margin page (leaf 1124) and a long-article page
    (leaf 465); new Phase 2 questions 5 (segmentation accuracy) and 6 (cut-off headwords: context or another copy);
    Phase 4 gets the two alphabetical sequences (main/supplement) and Дьяченко's errata table (leaves 32–36).
  Phase 3a done.

NEXT: Phase 2 — choose the 6 ground-truth pages (PLAN.md Phase 2, incl. Rev. 3 notes), transcribe them into
djachenko/eval/gt/NNNN.txt (ask the user whether they want to check the transcriptions), write tools/dj_eval.py, and
measure: definition text CER of the ABBYY layer (take the text from ocr/*.json), entry segmentation (entries_hint),
and the headword candidates (a: vision on column images, b: vision on headword crops from entries_hint[].bbox).
